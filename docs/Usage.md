### Crafting a Quality

A step by step tutorial on how to make a quality:

**Id**: Your quality must have a unique number. All vanilla Id's are numbers below 200.000, so it's not recommended to go below this. Pick an arbitrarily high number for this.

<sup>tip: Properly note the Id's of your quality in a word/txt file. This will help you later<sup>

**Name**: Give your quality a name.

**Description**: Give your quality a description.

**Image**: The image for your quality. Image must:

1. have small behind the name (`examplesmall.png`)
2. be a .png
3. be `40x52` in size

This field requires the name of the image **without** `small` and `.png`

**Persistent**: Does this quality stay with your captain when they die? If yes, check this box.

**Nature**: The class of the quality. Can be either "Status", "Thing" or "Unspecified".
